# watching_eyes

## Simple python script to render 2 eyes and have them track motion (seems to work better than actual recognition for my use case) . Very dirty code, hacked together in an hour or two create a spooky halloween effect. 

## Todo
- Fix Jittering
- Remove / Correct the ellipse (attempt at eye vein)
- Make the code not hideous
